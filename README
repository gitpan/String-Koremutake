NAME
    String::Koremutake - Convert to/from Koremutake Memorable Random Strings

SYNOPSIS
      use String::Koremutake;
      my $k = String::Koremutake->new;

      my $s = $k->integer_to_koremutake(65535);        # botretre
      my $i = $k->koremutake_to_integer('koremutake'); # 10610353957

DESCRIPTION
    The String::Koremutake module converts to and from Koremutake Memorable
    Random Strings.

    The term "Memorable Random String" was thought up by Sean B. Palmer as a
    name for those strings like dopynl, glargen, glonknic, spoopwiddle, and
    kebble etc. that don't have any conventional sense, but can be used as
    random identifiers, especially in URIs to keep them persistent. See
    http://infomesh.net/2001/07/MeRS/

    Koremutake is a MeRS algorithm which is used by Shorl
    (http://shorl.com/koremutake.php). As they explain: "It is, in plain
    language, a way to express any large number as a sequence of syllables.
    The general idea is that word-sounding pieces of information are a lot
    easier to remember than a sequence of digits."

INTERFACE
  new()
    The new() method is the constructor:

  integer_to_koremutake($i)
    The integer_to_koremutake method converts a positive integer to a
    Koremutake string:

      my $s = $k->integer_to_koremutake(65535);        # botretre

  koremutake_to_integer($s)
    The koremutake_to_integer method converts a Koremutake string to the
    integer it represents:

      my $i = $k->koremutake_to_integer('koremutake'); # 10610353957
